# bootcamp-quiz
I made a quiz for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp, using The Duck as decor and UofO colors in style.
The questions are from W3 schools, and the quiz-taker has one minute to answer.  If they get the answer wrong, time is taken off the clock. 
The final score is a product of the number correct and the time left on the clock.  The button to save the score will do show and the score will appear in the console.
